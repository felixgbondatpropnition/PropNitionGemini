      description: 'Security tokens are blockchain-based tokens that represent a financial security such as equity, debt, or other investment contracts. Real estate tokens typically qualify as security tokens because they represent an investment in a common enterprise with expectation of profits.',

        'Tokens representing ownership shares in a REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust)',
        'Tokens that entitle holders to rental income from a commercial property',

      description: 'Smart contracts are self-executing programs stored on a blockchain that automatically enforce the terms of an agreement. In real estate tokenization, smart contracts enable automated compliance, dividend distributions, and ownership transfers without requiring intermediaries.',
      examples: [
        'A smart contract that automatically distributes rental income to token holders every month',
        'A smart contract that enforces transfer restrictions based on investor accreditation status',

    'regulatory compliance': {
      description: 'Regulatory compliance refers to the adherence to laws and regulations governing tokenized real estate. Since real estate tokens typically qualify as securities, they must comply with securities laws in the jurisdictions where they are offered and sold.',

    'fractional ownership': {
      description: 'Fractional ownership is a method where multiple investors share ownership of a high-value asset, such as real estate. Tokenization enables fractional ownership by dividing property rights into small, affordable units represented by digital tokens.',
      examples: [
        'A $1M vacation home divided into 1,000 tokens worth $1,000 each',
        'Multiple investors owning shares of a commercial building through tokens',
        'A collective of token holders sharing ownership and income from a rental property'

    'liquidity': {
      description: 'Liquidity refers to the ease with which an asset can be converted to cash without affecting its market price. Tokenization aims to increase real estate liquidity by enabling fractional ownership and secondary market trading of property tokens.',

  faq: {
    'What is real estate tokenization?': {
      answer: 'Real estate tokenization is the process of converting ownership rights in a property into digital tokens on a blockchain. These tokens represent fractional ownership in the underlying real estate asset, allowing for smaller investment amounts, increased liquidity, and programmable features like automated income distribution.',

    },
    'Is real estate tokenization legal?': {
      answer: 'Yes, real estate tokenization is legal in most jurisdictions, but it must comply with applicable securities laws, property laws, and financial regulations. Since real estate tokens typically qualify as securities, they must follow the securities laws of each jurisdiction where they are offered or sold. This often means registering the offering or qualifying for an exemption, implementing KYC/AML procedures, and adhering to transfer restrictions.',

    'How much does it cost to tokenize a property?': {
      answer: 'The cost of tokenizing a property typically ranges from $30,000 to $150,000 for initial setup, depending on the complexity of the structure, the jurisdiction, and the specific requirements. Key cost components include legal structuring ($5,000-$20,000), securities compliance ($10,000-$50,000), smart contract development ($15,000-$40,000), and platform integration ($5,000-$25,000). Ongoing annual costs for compliance, management, and platform fees can range from $8,000 to $25,000 or more.',

    'What is the process for tokenizing a property?': {
      answer: 'The process for tokenizing a property typically involves: 1) Legal structure setup (creating an SPV or LLC to hold the property), 2) Regulatory compliance planning (choosing the right exemption or registration path), 3) Token design and smart contract development, 4) Property transfer to the legal entity, 5) Marketing and investor documents preparation, 6) Token issuance and distribution to investors, and 7) Ongoing management and compliance. The timeline usually ranges from 4-12 months depending on regulatory approach and property complexity.',

    },
    'Which properties are best suited for tokenization?': {
      answer: 'Properties best suited for tokenization typically have: 1) Clear income generation potential (e.g., rental income), 2) Stable or growing value, 3) Minimal debt or lender approval for tokenization, 4) Sufficient value to justify tokenization costs (typically $1M+), 5) Appeal to a broader investor base, and 6) Low regulatory complications. Commercial properties, multi-family residential, and premium real estate in desirable locations often make good candidates. Single-family residential with strong rental income can also work well.',
